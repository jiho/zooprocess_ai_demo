# Demonstration of the zooprocess AI modules

Through the [iMagine](https://www.imagine-ai.eu) project, two AI-based modules were developed by the [Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie de Villefranche (LOV)](https://lov.imev-mer.fr/) and the company [FOTONOWER](http://fotonower.com/) to deal with images generated by the [ZooScan](http://www.hydroptic.com/index.php/public/Page/product_item/ZOOSCAN) instrument and processed with [ZooProcess](https://sites.google.com/view/piqv/softwares/flowcamzooscan).

These images sometimes contain several organisms which impair the rest of the image processing and identification process. The goal of these modules is to detect such images ([classify them](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/zooprocess-multiple-classifier)) and then to [separate the objects](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/zooprocess-multiple-separator) numerically on the images. The final goal of this project is to integrate these features in a new version of ZooProcess.

This repository is a collection of tutorials on how to use them in a standalone way, for now.
